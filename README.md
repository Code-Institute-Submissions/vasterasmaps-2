<h1>Photo Attractions in Västerås</h1>
<p>This is my Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute.</p>

<p>This is a one-page website that includes 6 photo spots listed in Index and pinned on Google Maps using Javascript and API. This project is aimed on Photo enthusiasts who are travellers. You can search for places that a Nature Photography and Architecture photography oriented. Users can also use default pins from google that show restaurants, hotels and other events.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>I ran user interviews with potential users as a first step and as a second step created a prototype that I then tested and also presented to my mentor. Tests were iterated and the design changed after feedback to meet the User's need. As a potential traveller the most interesting genres in photography would be architecture and attractions, landscapes and nature altogether.</p> 

<h2>My goals were:</h2><br>
<li> To create a responsive website which is welcoming</li>
<li> Focus on just two genres in photography for the MVP which is Nature and Architecture. This later can be developed</li>
<li> Attach brief information about each attraction on the website itself and on the pin windows with images</li>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>The wireframes are created with Adobe XD as part of the design process. They were later saved in PDF, which is called Wireframes_Västerås_Maps. Page 1 is designed for desktop view and page 2 for mobile view.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Existing Features</h3>
<p>The presentation text is placed to the right side of the page and a picture of historcal Västerås to the right. This information gives the users a short information about the site use and attractions in Västerås. </p>

<p>After introduction there is a section that explains which areas of photography can be interesing in this town and after that a map follows under. On the section's title there is a camera icon to visually present a photo spots. This same icon will be used later in the map.</p>

<p>The map itself has pins with the same icon used on the title for this section. That way the user can find photo spots without being distracted by other secondary events on the map. The pins themselves have a windows which holds a title, short information about the spot and image. It is activated when clicked on and can be closed by clickikng on "X".</p>

<h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>
<p>In the future I would like to add more locations, a filter with categories: Landscape, Waterscape, Monuments, Creative spots, Ruins and so on. This might be presented as a dropdown or buttons. I might want to use Google Library to hide or show events like Hotels, Restaurants etc.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>The languages I have used for this project is HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I have used the Bootstrap gridsystem as well, with the built in media queries for the content to be responsive. Also I have made use of Fontawsome icon library.</p>

<p>Other tools are Gitpod for development for writing code and debugging. I also commited my files to Github where the project is stored and deployed.</p>

<p>I used Google maps Maps Javascript API, created and used an API key, to generate the maps on the page.
As part of the design process I used Adobe XD to make my wireframes and skethed the by hand earlier. I skipped creating a prototype in Hi-fidelity, though that is some I would do if given the time.</p>
  
<p>I used http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ to check how responsive the website is.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>I wrote briefly about this in section UX:</p>

<p>User stories:</p>
<p>As a Traveller and Photo enthusiast I do research before visting my destination. This time I will Visit Västerås. I may use my laptop or mobile phone. I am also more interested in Architecture than any other genre. --> This information can easily be found on the go on a smartphone or desktop.</p>

<p>I study in Västerås and photography is my hobby. I love the nature and also new in town. This weeked I plan to take a photo walk and mostly interested in nature. Would like to combine a good walk with some fresh air and also photo shoot and test my phone that has a great camera. I normally surf with my mobile phone, but this time I am studying and have my laptop infront of me, though later I may want to use my phone on the spot. I do research before visting my destination. --> This information can easily be found on desktop and mobile.</p>

<h2>Validation of code</h2>
<li>I used this website to validate my HTML by direct input.</li>
<li>I used this website to validate my CSS by direct input.</li>
<li>I used JS Hint to check my Javascript code for errors and potential problems.</li>
<li>Tested the responsiveness of the whole website on http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ and just console. </li>
<li>The webpage is fully responsive for these devices: Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2XL, IPhone 5 SE, Iphone 6/7/8, IPhone 6/7/8 Plus, Iphone X, tested in Chrome Developer Tools and Responsinator. </li>
<li>Also performed Audits on Chrome Developer.</li>
<li>Did accessibility tests and the result is satisfactory. Over all the stucture is logical and contrast satisfactory. To make the website 100% accessible, more use of ARIA is recommended.</li>

<h2>Testing process scenarios</h2>
<li>Tested reponsivness and visible information by resizing the browser and using Chrome Developer tool.</li>
<li>clicked all pins on the map and made sure the name, description and image are visible and act as expected.</li> 
<li>checked perfomance with LightHouse on Audits in Chrome developer.</li>


<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>This website is hosted on GitHub pages, and deployed from the master branch with following steps:</p>

<li>In the repository, click on settings in top right corner.</li>
<li>Scroll down the page to GitHub Pages section.</li>
<li>In the source dropdown you choose the alternative master branch.</li>
<li>The published link will appear in the GitHub Pages section.</li>
<li>Click on the link and you will reach the website.</li>
<li>Upon new commits to the master branch, the deployed site will automatically update. The landing page must be named index.html for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages.</li>

<p> Preferable method to commit to master or branch in github: To run locally- You can clone this repository directly into the editor you prefer by following these steps:
<li>Download all files in gitpod</li>
<li>Upload files to Github and commit to masters or branch.</li>
<li>Changes can be made on GitHub or on Gitpod by click on the green button "Gitpod"</li></p>
